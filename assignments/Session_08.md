### **Midterm 2nd Iteration**    
Taking class feedback into account, submit a second iteration of your midterm project. 
- Double check the [midterm project](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Pokorny-MTEC1201_D10-Fall2025/blob/main/assignments/MIDTERM.md) requirements to make sure that your midterm is meeting all requirements. 
- In this second iteration, pay particular attention to improving user experience and refinement. 
- Save the second iteration with file name "Midterm-V2-[FirstName + Last Initial]" (for example, "Midterm-V2-IanP"). Submit to your Github class repo.
